## Important

This version of the website was made in a rush to make a school deadline. The web pages, components and scss for the most part will be re-written/modified or replaced before a proper release ~2022.

## Why?

This personal website was originally created for a school assignment and I thought it would be a waste to do nothing with it, so I've turned it into a personal portfolio that I can update as I go and display my work as a developer and artist.

# Access
