## Important
This version of the website was made in a rush to make a school deadline, for example in portfolio there is a div repeated 11 times when it should be a JS component, this was done in crunch time and is not final like a lot of this website.
The web pages, components and scss for the most part will be re-written/modified or replaced before a proper release ~January 2022.

## Why?
This personal website was originally created for a school assignment and I thought it would be a waste to do nothing with it, so I've turned it into a personal portfolio that I can update as I go and display my work as a developer and artist. (I haven't actually officially done that yet)
